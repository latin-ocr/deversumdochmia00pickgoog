‘Logaoedic' Matre in Greek Comedy 11

Cratinus used the pentameter in the Πυλαὺι (172). Cf. Lys. 3281.
:342 f, and in varying form Ach. 115of. = 1162 f, 1154 f. = 1166 f.

In the Lysistrata (319, 320) Aristophanes employs two catalectic
choriambic tetrameters to introduce the parodos of the women:

λιγνὺν δοκῶ μοι καθορᾶν
καὶ καπνὸν ὦ γυναῖκες
ὥσπερ πυρὸς καομένου·
σπευστέον ε’στὶ θᾶττον.

Ηε has the same verse elsewhere: Nub. 700 h: 804 f, 949 h:
1024 f., 951 h: 1026 i, Lyn. 327: 341, Eccl. 970 : 974. The
iambic syzygy which begins the period has the fixed constitution ..υ.
except twice, where it is ..... Anacreon had used the verse in a lreer
form (frag. 24) τ

ἀναπέτομαι δὴ πρὸς Ὀλυμ-

πον πτερύγεσσι κούφαις

διὰ τὸν Ἔρωτ’· οὗ γὰρ ἐμοὶ
ταῖς ἐθέλει συνηβᾶν. ¹

ΤΙιε metricians were here in doubt as to the constitution ol the first
foot. Did it result from the resolution of a choriambus or ot a pure
iambic dipody? Cf. Heph. 31, 6ff.: Ἀνακρέων δὲ ἐπετήδευσε τὴν
πρώτην συζυγίαν δι’ ὅλου ᾅσματος έκ τριβράχεος καὶ ἰάμβου ποιῆσαι,
ὥς εἶναι κοινὴν λύσιν τῆς τε χοριαμβικῆς καὶ τῆς ἰαμβικῆς. Cf. Schol.
Heph. 181, 14 ff.

Aristophanes can have felt no objection to this torm in itself, since
he employs itin the iambic part of mixed choriambic cola, not only in
dimeters (Vesp. 1453 : 1465, 1455, 1456 z 1468, Lys. 324, 325), but
also in a trimeter (Thesm. 992 h), and in a pentameter (Lys. 328 i.);
but in a well-known passage, with rare humor, he has used Anacreon’s
peculiar tetrameter ‘with variations’ to travesty the extravagances of

the dithyramhic poet Cinesias. ln Aves 1372 f. he introduces Cinesias '
singing the very words of the lyric poet:

1372 f. ἀναπέτομαι δὴ πρὸς Ὄλυμπον πτερύγεσσι κούφαις·

Hereupon the comic poet immediately begins to ring all possible
changes (they are all impossible according to his own practice) on the
