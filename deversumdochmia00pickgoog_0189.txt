The ode begins with four and closes with three iambic cola. (On
colon 4 see p. 8.) The transition is through choriambic cola (5, 6)
to Glyconic‚ which are followed by a logaoedic hexapody.

Bothe corrected ξυνευχόμεθα (R) in r, Dindori εὔγματα γενέσθω
(R) in 3, Hermann ἐξαπατῶσι (R) in 6 and ἀσεβοῦσιν ἀδικοῦσιν (R)
in 15, and Bentley ἕνεκ’ (R) in 8 (cf. 14). In 12 λέγουσ’ is due to
Suidas (λέγουσιν R), andin 14 κερδῶν to Reiske (χώρας R).

Hiatus in 8, 14. This is extremely rare at the close of the acatalectic
dimeter.

Isolated antispastie dimeters occur in the extant comedies oi Aristo
phanes, as Vesp. 3'19-322 (τηροῦμαι κτὲ.) in transition from prosodiacs to
anapaests, and the reirain Ὑμὴν ὦ Ὑμέναι’ ὦ, Aves 1736: 1742,1743,
following prosodiacs, and Aves 1754, at the close oi a dactylic series.

III Polysclzematist Cela

In all the cola thus far considered in this investigationi the only other ,

form that has occurred in combination with choriamb or antispast to
constitute a colon has been the iambic syzygy. The choriambic colon,
if not pure, is ἐπίμικτον πρὸς τὰς ῖαμβικάς (Heph. 30, 7); the anti-
spastic colon always combines at least one iambic syzygy, acatalectlc or
catalectie, with the antispast or antispasts (Heph. 32, 15 ft).

But there occurs also the combination oi antispast with choriambus,
in the order named (Μ ,ου-7, the antispast now admitting an addi-
