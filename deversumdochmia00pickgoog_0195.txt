schematist dimeter and catalectic trochaic dimeter, is not borne out by
the facts and probably arises from an incautious interpretation of the
account of it given by Hephaestion, as follows (59, rff.): καὶ τὸ
Εὖπολίδειον τὸ καλούμενον ἐπιχοριαμβικὸν πολυσχημάτιστόν ἔστιν, frgi

τὰς τροχαῖκὰς παρὰ τάξιν ποιοῦσι δέχεσθαι τὸν σπονδεῖον· ε’νίοτε δὲ καὶ

ἅντισπαστικὸν καθαρὸν ποιοῦσιν, οἷον

εὐφράνας ἡμᾶς ἄπόπεμπ’ οἴκαδ’ ἄλλον ἄλλοσε.

ὁ σώφρων τε χῶ καταπύγων ἄριστ’ ἠκουσάτην.

1t is important to note, first, that Hephaestion's phrasing, “pure
antispast,’' shows that he regards the ‘trochaic' clement also as auti·
spastic (see p. 13 f.), and secondly, that the examples which he quotes
make it clear that when he speaks of variations in the form of these
‘trochaic’ syzygies of the verse, he is thinking of the first half of it
quite as much as the second. This understood, no exception need be
taken to his account of it, especially in view of the brevity of statement
that he imposed upon himself throughout his Manual. He is explaining
the form of a¹ polyschematist tetrameter in which he has observed two
prevailing forms in the two cola that compose it, namely .υ..ῦ ,ου-
and .... .υυ. in the first halland .υ.ῦ .υ. and .... .υ. in the
second half, with important substitutes that take the forms ΕΑ .υυ.
and M .υ.. He might proceed from any one of these three sets
of forms to explain the combinations of ‘trochaic’ ‘spondaic,’ and
antispastic elements that appear in the first and third syzygies, but the
‘trochaic’ is obviously the simplest. The assumption that the funda·
mental rhythm is trochaic would be erroneous‚ but is no doubt furtherod
by the form of κατάληξις, since .o! is the normal κατακλείς of both
choriambic and trochaic metres.

Probably it is from this point of view that the verse named Κρατίναον
should be approaehed, as a combination of choriambie dimeter and
polyschematist dimeter, but here in the pure form of the verse the
‘ trochaic' syzygy prevails in the third foot to the exclusion of all other
forms. Hephaestion describes it as follows (55, 7ff.): ἔστιγὰρ fx
χοροαμβικοῦ ἔπιμίκτου, τοῦ τὴν δευτέραν ἱαμβικὴν ἔχοντος, καὶ τροχαῖ·
κοῦ ἔφθημιμεροῦς· He then quotes from Cratinus (324) :

Εῧιε κισσοχαῖτ’ ἅναξ, 1 .υυ. υ..υ.

χαῖρ’ dpoox’ Ἐκφαντίδης, ..υ., .o.
