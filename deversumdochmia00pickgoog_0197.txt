These Jumbled quotations from Euripides are in truth a medley, not
only oi incongmous sentiments‚ but also oi varied and, as Aristophanes
believed, vicious metrical forms. The comic poet has managed to bring
together in brief space a great variety oi cola.l The first appears to be
nn extravagant variation of the Sapphic hendecasyllable (Heph. 43,
19 i), the prefixed syllable striking the note that is heard more clearly
in the trimeter that follows in the sixth colon. Cola 2, 7, 11, 17, are
polyschematist dimeters, the first two with catalexis, as in the last half
oi the Eupolidean. These two are not pure catalectic trochaic dimeters,
controlled hythe colonie stress appropriate to trochaics. Pure trochnic
cola have no business in this ‘mixed' company! In 7, .υυυ. seems
a wild extravagance, but it is identical in form with Casaubon's restora-

¹ The metrical constitution ol some ol these cola is necessarily doubtful, and the
attempt to determine it can be no more than tentative in some cases. As to the finr
colon, Aristophanes has ἀείνων (υ--) in Ran. 147, but ἀενάοις (-υυ-) in Ναὶ).
275. In Attic lyric poetry‚ including the lyries ol Euripides, ἀέναος is invariably
-υυυ, The colon, therefore, cannot be iamhic (-υυυ- υυνυ- υ--). Νοταιιι
the second and seventh cola be classified as syncopated iamblc dimetas, henaim
ol the short ultimates. No syllaba anceps occurs in the ode, in acatalectic 001⁸, and
hiatus oocurs only in 4, where there is shilt to a new theme.
