‘LOGAOEDIC’ METRE IN GREEK COMEDY

Bu Jonn Wifflhusjvnnn

HORIAMBUS (.υυ.) or “catalectic dactylic dipody” (.υυ l .Λ)Ρ
Pure choriambic cola ( ........ and ............ ) or
“syncopated dactyls” (-oolr. l-Wlss· and ,volu karole. l ,υυ l u. )?
Choriambic dimeter (υ.υ. -υυ.) or “syncopated logaoedics” (υ ξ ,ul ’
ι. l-uu l ι. )? Autispastic dimeter (Glyconic: υυυυυυυυ ) or “ loga-
oedic tetrapody'’ with ‘dactyl' in the second place (υ ξι. l.uul.ol-,)?
Polyschematist dimeter (ῦ-.ῦ .υυ.) or “logaoedic tetrapody’' with
‘dactyl’ in the third place (6521.6l.uul.,)? ln a word, the
metrical explanations of forms that abound in Greek poetry which are'
given by eminent Greek metricians, or a theory of the ‘rhythmical'
structure oi these forms that 'has' little, if any, support in ancient
tradition? Tbese questions are ol importance sufficient to warranto
thorough reconsideration oi the material to which they relate.

' Definitions of logaoedic metre are given by Hephaestion and Aristi-
des Quintilianus. These, unhappily, are not complete. The reason oi
this, however, is apparent: the metre was relatively unimportant. Both
authors add their statements about it to their general treatment of the
larger subjects of dactylic and anapaestic metres. But the essential fact
is made clear. Hephaestion briefly defines logaoedic metre to be the
combination, within the same colon, oi two or more dactyls with a
trochaic syzygy, or, in ascending rhythm, of two or more anapaests with
a catalectic iambic syzygy (bacchius). The most noted form, he adds,
in the second category has four anapaests, the first of which may be a
spondee or iambus.1 Logaoedic cola, thus defined, are comparatively
rare in Greek comedy.²

altogether singular in the great number ol logaoedic cola it contains.
