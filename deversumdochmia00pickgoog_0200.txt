·Logaoedic' Merra in Greek Comedy 33

precisely the metrical constitution oi one of the forms with which the
heroic hexameter closes (...ou.!). This is, oi course,a large ‘il’3
even conservative Aristophanes begins the Pherecratean with four inter-
changeable forms. Furthermore the Glyconic, if one fixes the form oi
its beginning in the same iashion as in the Pherecratean, and accounts
its last syllable anceps and assumes it to be always short (it is always .
long in Aristophanes), has the metrical constitution oi one ol the forms
with which the hexameter may open (.--υυ.υυ). The Glyconic and
Pherecratean, therefore, were a great resource ior any metrieian who
was endeavoringto prove that Greek metres were derived from the
heroic hexameter. Accordingly we find, in the prolix pages ascribed
to Victorinus, all possible changes rung on his tiresome “sic te diva
potens Cypri' and “grato Pyrrha sub antro.'' Not that he regarded
the metrical constitution oi the Glyconic as dactylic;‘three times in
describing metres oi Horace (and also elsewhere) he composes it oi
spondeus, choriambus, and pariambus (trochaeus, spondeus). But it
was extremely useiul to him in arguing lor his fantastic and unhistorical
theory of the derivation oi metres. That is the purpose with which he
rings the changes on the Glyconic, and one should be cautious in assum-
ing that he has any other, namely that he believes and is endeavoring
to show that the rhythm oi this colon, as apart from its metre, is
’ dactylic,a conception that in itseli is not easy to grasp. There isa
striking passage in the first chapter oi his iourth book¹ which seems

¹ “Ad summam omnia metra, et quae inter se congruunt, et quae temporum
ratione contraria sunt, si plenius consideres, ab heroo traducta sunt. et mehercules
siquis excutere penitus velit, inveniet, ut supra diximus, omnia genera ab hexametro
heroo et trimetro iambico derivata, quamvis et iambicum heroi sit traductivum, nec
quicquam sine bis per se posse subsistere. unde, ut dirdmus, haec duo metra ut
elementa cetemrum ac semina habenda merito ac dicenda sunt. haec ita videri atque
esse, ut diximus, si studiosa contemplatione exempla quae proponuntur adverteris, ·
adprobabis. nam metrorum species, quamvis generis sui privilegio distinctae sint,
tamen misceri inter se atque diversis communia effici ea videlicet ratione, qua cuncta,

ν ut dictum est, ex eadem origine atque uno fonte derivantur, sic comprehenditur.

legimus apud Horatium
sic te diva potens Cypri:

hoc glyconium metrum dicitur, quod constat ex spondeo choriambo et ultimo trochaeo
vel eodem spondeo. commune hoc esse cum heroo trimetro, quod constat ex spondeo
et duobus dactylis, cunetis in promptu est‚” etc. (Keil Vl, 146, 147.)
