Isolated choriambic periods and single cola are found elsewhere in
the comedim, as the tetrameter Aves 1724 i. at the close of an iambo·
trochaic series, the catalectic trimeter Ran. 213 3 the catalectic dimeter,
at the close ol a trochaic period in each ease, Eccl. 902 = 908, 905 =
9105 and the succession oi catalectic dimeters, Pax 785-787 = 807-
899, in transition to dactyls.

Choriambic cola aud periods occurred in other plays of Aristophanes,
no longer extant, and in those of other poets of the Old Comedy.
Hephaestion ( 30, 21 ff.) quotes the Αἰολοσίκων (10 Kock):

οὒκ ε’τός, ὦ γυναῖκες,
πᾶσι κακοῖσιν ἡμᾶς
φλῶσιν ἑκάστοθ’ ἄνδρες·
δεινὰ γὰρ ἔργα δρῶσαι
λαμβανόμεσθ’ ὕπ’ αὐτῶν.

cf. Eupolis, Κόλακες 163 (Kock): '

ὃς χαρίτων μὶν ὄζει
καλλαβίδας δὲ βαίνει,
σησαμίδας δὲ χέζει,
μῆλα δὲ χρέμπτεται.

The last colon,1 in appearance, is the catalectic form of the preceding
cola. The sentiment precludes the dochmius. See above, p. 8 h

Pure acatalectic dimeters occur among the fragments of Aristophanes
in 11 and 533 (K.). A tetrameter, quoted by Hephaestion (31, 16),
occurred in the Ἀμφιάρεως (30) t

οἶδα μὲν ἀρχαῖόν τι δρῶν

κοῦχὶ λέληθ’ ἐμαυτόν.

This has been called “first Priapean” (p. 4). It occurs not inire·
quently in Aristophanes in extant plays. Cf. Ach. 1152 1: 1164 i,
Nub. 512 f.‚ 567 h: 599 i„ 957 i.:1o3ai. In the Κόλακες of
Eupolis (159) it is used by line in a fragment of sixteen verses. ct.
also Eupolis 38 and 361.

¹ This combination has been much discussed, and it ia thought by some scholam to
be the basis ol the tornis ol scoliastic verse that are iound in Eocl. 941 = 945 md

vesp. 1245-1247. See p. 17 below.
