‘Logaoedic' Matre in Greek Comedy 35

apparent irregularity oi form. Nor must these particular iambics be
regarded as singular in constitution becarise oi their association with
mixed metres. There are twenty odd lyries in Aristophanes composed
in pure iambie metre, and in these are found not only nearly all the
forms oi the dimeter that have been given above, but also many others,
such (omitting catalectic cola) as υυυυ. υυυυ., υ.υυυ ..υ., ..υυυ
..υ., υυυυυυ υ.υ., ..υ. υυυυ., ..υ- ..υυυ, ..υ- .υυυ-, ..υ-
· .υυυυυ, υυυυυυ υυυυυυ, etc. In comparison with these iambic cola,
the mixed choriambic seem singulary staid and regular, admitting variety
oi form only through their admixture with iambic syzygies. The anti-
spastic dimeters likewise show relatively a small number of different
forms, but in these and the polyschematist dimeters the,ior1ns seem to
be more irregular.

But in what does this irregularity consist? The colonie stress in all
these cola seems to be iambic. Iambie form, at least, prevails almost
everywhere. It is exclusive in the considerable number oi pure iambie
dimeters that are ireely combined, in the lyrics which have been
analyzed above, with choriambic and antispastic dimeters; mixed ehor-
iambic dimeters and antispastic dimeters are themselves always ἒπίμικτα
πρὸς τὰς ἷαμβικάς. This fact may indicate the way to the solution ot
the vexed question of the apparent irregularity oi form and alleged laek
oi rhythm in these dimeters, and this solution may be approached most
easily by consideration oi the Glyconic. This, in its normal constitution,
according to Hephaestion, is υ..υ υ-υ., antispast and iambic syzygy.
Τὴε disturbanee of the normal rhythm in this dimeter, assuming the
rhythm to be iambie, may be accounted ior by the principle with which
we are familiar in modem music oi inversion oi rhythmic streSS, or
syncopation. In modern music the rhythmic beat falls on the note at
the beginning oi the measure; in aseending rhythm in Greek it falls on
the note at the end. Adapting the form oi statement to the Greek
practice, syncopation in iambie rhythm was the process oi inverting the
normal rhythmic stress by beginning a tone on an aecented beat and
sustaining it into an unaecented one so that the proper emphasis was,
in greater or less degree, carried iorward to the latter.1 Thus, whereas

iambic rhythm, in which the down-beat follows the upbeat, was the process ol invert-
ing the normal order ol arsis and thesis. 1 purposely avoid raising a question that has
