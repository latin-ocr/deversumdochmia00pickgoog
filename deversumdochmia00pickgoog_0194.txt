‘Logaocdic' Matre in Greek Comedy 27

cf. Cratinus 74, 318. Pherecrates also used the verse, as in 64:

κᾶτα μυροπωλεῖν τί παθόντ’

ἄνδρ’ ε’χρῆν καθήμενον

cf. also Pherecrates 29, 47, 122, 132,191‚ Eupolis 78, 120, Aristo·
phanes 54, 55, Plato 92, 169, Alexis 206 and 237. The last reads:

The textos some of these fragments is uncertain. In colon 15 of
Cratinus 98 the manuscripts of Athenaeus read καὶ κύτισος. Hermann
proposed καὶγὰρ, Porson κάμοὶ, Meineke καὶ δὴ The resultiugiorm
(..υυυ) is not found elsewhere. Likewise κᾶτα μυροπωλεῖν in the
first colon oi Pherecrates 64 is Casaubon's correction ol καταμυροπω·
λεῖν. This gipes υυυυυ (ior -υ.-), which cannot be paralleled in-
Eupolidean verse.

The theory here advanced that the Eupolidean verse is a combination
ol the acatalectic and catalectic forms ol the polyschematist dimeter
seems to be established by the factS, and the verse, thus regarded, has
its exact parallel in the pure Priapean, which combines Glyconic and
catalectic Glyconic (Pherecratean). See p. 15. The ordinary expla-
nation oi this period found in modern books, that it consists oi a poly-
