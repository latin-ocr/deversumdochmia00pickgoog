‘Logaoedic' Matre in Greek Comcdy

1 Chon‘ambic Cala

The choriambus, as such, disappears under the current modern
analysis. It is no longer a fundamental ioot (.υυ.) used as consti·
tuent clement oia μέτρον reporimus, but a catalectic dactylic dipody
(wolff), Hephaestion, however, lor whom this πούς was as real an
element in metre as the dactyl or iambus, devotes a chapter ol his
Manual to it. The chapter begins (30, 6 ff.): τὸ χοριαμβικὸν συντί-
θεται μὶν καὶ καθαρόν, συντίθεται bd καὶ ἆπίμικπον πρὸς τὰς ἶαμβικάς·
ὥς ε’πίπαν δι’, ὅτε καταληπτικόν ἆστιν, είς τὴν ιἀμβεκὴν κατακλεῖδα
περαιοῦται, τοῦτ’ ἔστιν, εἶς ἅμφίβραχνν, ἢ βακχεῖον δαὶ τὴν ἀδιάφορον.
This simple statement adequately explains the metrical constitution ol
many lyrics in Aristophanes.

In order to secure greater ease in analysis, the cola are here printed
separately, each in its own line, aiter the manner of the Alexandrines.
Catalexis marks the close ol a period or hypermetron. The combina-
tion oi choriambic cola in Aristophanes is generally hypermetrical.
Hiatus and syllaba anceps in acatalectic cola are extremely rare3 they
will be noted whenever they thus occur.

The commation that has just been quoted (Nubes 510-517) begins
with an anapaestic movement. Compare the beginning ol the comma-
tion that introduces the parabasis in the Vespae (1009 fh), where the
lyric movement that follows is trochaic.

The remaining cola are all dimeters, rhythmic πόδες of the normal
measurement ol eight syllables and twelve times, with catalexis in 2, 6,
and the commonly allowed irrational element in the odd places oi the
