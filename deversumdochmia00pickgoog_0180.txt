‘Logaoedic' Matre in Greek Comedy 13

, Since Aristophanes himself never resolves either long ot the choriam-
bus uor contracts its shorts, his audience would be quiclr to appreciate
me inimitable skill with which he genially brought the resources ot
metric into the service of his art as comic poet.

II Autispastic Cela
Since G. Hermann’s assault upon the antispast and his celebrated

¹ invention oi a “basis'’ scholars have fought shy oi this much abused

loot and it has disappeared from the modern booles.1 Hermann, to be
sure, could not completely abandon the choriamb, and in his hands
Sappho’s κατθναίσκει, Κυθέρη’, ἅβρος Ἀδωνις· τί κε Otium· (Heph.
34, 13) became a “choriambicum curn basi.” The logaoedists goa
long way farther and make it ->‘i ,ου l ι. Ι ,ου l ι. l ,ου l ,63
Hephaestion, however, who had no premonition of the advanced
investigations of the nineteenth century, and apparently found nothing
in antecedent practice to give him pause, recognizes antispastic metre
and devotes a chapter to it. This begins (32, 15 ff.) : τὸ ἀντισταστι-
κὸν τὴν μὲν πρώτην συζυγίαν ἔχει τρεπομένην κατὰ τὸν πρότερον πόδα
εἰς τὰ τέσσαρα τοῧ δισσυλλόβου σχήματα· τὰς δὲ έν μέσῳ, καθαρὰς
ἄντισπαστικός· τὴν δέ τελευταίαν ὁπότε ἐστὶν ἅκατόληκτον, ίαμβικήν·
ε’ἆν δὲ ἇναμίσγηται ταῖς ιἀμβικαῐς, οὗ μόνον τὴν πρώτην συζυγίαν ἔχει
τρεπομένην κατὰ τὸν πρότερον πόδα, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν ταῖς ίαμβικαῐς irro-
μένην. ἔστι δε ὅτε καὶ λύεται ὁ πρότερος ποὺς εἶς τρίβραχυν. Itis
important to note what the variable tour-syllabled clement is that under
this definition begins the dvrturruortxhv μέτρον. It may be υ..υ or
.υ.υ or ...υ or υυ.υ or υυυ.υ. These are all antispastic ‘syzygies ς’

¹1t has been treated with dowuright contumely. T. Reinach speaks ol it es
“l'horrible antispaste‚’' and in general it is viewed askance by the new school, but
possibly it may be rehabilitated. lt is at least true that Westphal’s statement that
the antispast was invented by Heliodorus can no longer be maintained. See Grenlell
aud Hunt, The Oxyrhynchus Papyri, Part ll, CCXX (p. 45, Col. Vlll, and p. 47,
Col. XIV).

² Rossbach and Westphal's analysis (Specielle Grieclzisclze Metrik, p. 5681.) is
bewildering. The tundamental part is a choriambic monometer and ‘first Phere-

cratean’ (Cou.1uu.u-!), To this is then prefixed a mtalectic Pherecratean
(ssata), and it is itsell then modified by shortening the ‘first Pherecratean’ to

the so-called Adonius (Ῐυυ-Ε). The result(!)is EG.uu.'uu.1uu.!,yetthjs
is the verse that Alcaeus, Sappho, and Anacreon so greatly aiiected.
