‘Logaoedic' Matre in Greek Comedy 17

A catalectic antispastic trimeter, with the second syzygy iambic‚ was
called by the metricians Φαλαίκαον. Cf. Hephaestion 33, 17 ff, who
quotes Cratinus (321),:

χαῖρ’ ὦ χρυσόκερως βαβίκτα κήλων,
Πάν, Πελασγικὸν Ἀργος ἐμβατεύων.

This trimeter occurs also in the following (1, 2) :

Ecclesiazusae 938-941 ; 942-945
εἶθ’ ἐξῆν παρὰ τῇ νέᾳ καθεύδειν
καὶ μὴ ’δει πρότερον διασποδῆσαι
940 ἀνάσιμον ἢ πρεσβυτέραν·
οὗ γὰρ ἀνασχετὸν τοῦτο γ’ ἐλευθέρῳ.

The correction oi πρεσβύτερον, the reading of the Mss. in 940, is
due to Bothe. For the apparent anapaest at the beginning of 3, see
p. 7 f. above, but the metrical constitution ot cola 3, 4, is uncertain.
No part of this lyric may be taken as exemplifyiug the usage ot Aristo-
phanes, since he here adopts a traditional form of the scolium‚ which
was an inheritance from an early time. Cf. the laughable use our poet
makes of the Phalaecean in Vesp. 1226, 1227, 1248, and with colon4
above, ct. Vesp. 1243-1247. These are the only instances of the
combination of choriamb aud antispast (iu this order) in Aristophanes.
-For a discussion ol this form oi the scolium, see von Wilamowitz,
An'stoteles und Athen, ΙΙ, 316 ff.

Aristophanes has used the Phalaecean, iu conjunction witha preceding
antispastic tetrameter, the greater Asclepiadean or Σαπφικὸν ἑκκαιδεκα-
σύλλαβαν (Heph. 35, 5 A), iu parodying Alcaeus (frag. 84), in Aves
1410 ff.:

ὄρνιθες τίνες οἷδ’ οὐδὲν ἔχοντες πτεροποίκιλοι,
τανυσίπτερε ποικίλα χελιδοῐ,·

ct. v. 1415. Aristophanes uses the torm υυ in the first part ol the
antispastic syzygy both here (in 1412, 1415) and in Rau. 13²4 iu
parody. With colon 1 cf. Vesp. 1238 (scoliastic). —In Milanges
