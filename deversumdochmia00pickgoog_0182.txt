‘Logaoedic’ Metre in Greek Comcdy ις

The lyric is parodic in tone. Aristophanes rarely uses the form
ot the first syzygy that appears in 1, 3. Cf. Thesm. 991. The song
begins with two hypermetra ol equal length, and ends with Pherecra-
teans The tetrameter in 7, 8 is a Priapean. See below. Bentley
wished to read τουτονὶ in 1258. In 1256 μέχρι νυνί is due to Meineke
for ἔτι νῦν (or νῦν ἔτ’) ὄντων of the MSS.

The acatalectic antispastic dimeter (Glyconic) occurred also in the
Γῆρας (140 K.), and the hephthemimeral form (Pherecratean) in
continuous series in the Κοριαννώ ol Pherecrates (79), quoted by

Hephaestion (33, 5) :

ἄνδρες, πρόσχετε τὸν νοῦν
ἑξευρήματι καινῷ,
συμπτύκτοις ἀναπαίστοις.

cf. Eupolis 162, Crates 33.

The catalectic antispastic tetrameter, with the second syzygy iamhic '
and with iambic close (a combination of Glyconic and Pherecratean)
was named Priapean (Heph. 34, 15 ft). cf. Cratinus 221 :

οὔδ’ Αἰξωνίδ’ ἐρυθρόχρων ’
ἐσθίειν ἔτι τρίγλην

οὐδὲ τρυγόνος, οὐδὲ δει-
νοῦ φυὴν μελανούρου -

ct. Cratinus 320, and Rau. 1257 f„ Nub. 57 3· f. = 605 l, Thesm. 1141 l.
Choriambic and antispastic cola may be combined in successive
series, as follows:

Equites 551-564 .-. 581-594

χαλκοκρότων ἵππων κτύπος
καὶ χρεμετισμὸς ἁνδάνει
καὶ κυανέμβολοι θοαὶ
