8 John Williams White

the poet is imitating the common form of the scolium, in which the
metrical constitution of the last two verses is uncertain. To pass to
iambics‚ ταχέως in Nub. 812 is no doubt a dissyllable‚ and in Thesm.
355 the mette may be lonie: υυυυυυυυ (anaclasis). The anapaest
does not occur, so faras I have observed, in any of the pure iambic
lyrics of Aristophanes. On the other hand, it is found in two poly-
schematist dimeters in both R and V, Vesp. 1461 = 1473. See p. 23.
ln Vesp. 1458, Kuster's change of φύσεως (R, V) to φύσεος is probably
right. Here the antode (1470) shows υυυ. The natural inference
from these facts is that the anapaest is faulty in all these places, espe-
cially when one recalls to mind the assault that Aristophanes, in Ran.
1322 ff, makes upon its use by Euripides in Glyconics. See p. 29 ff.
A form of iambic dimeter occurs in the antode of this lyric (4)
that must be accounted defective (.υυ.υυ ..υ.), but who shall say
’ that Aristophanes did not compose it? Here also the commentators
have essayed changes: ὥς τριταλαντοῐα βάρος Bentley, δεῦρο τριτάλον·
τόν τι βάρος Reisig, etc, but the same fault is found in two iambic
dimeters in the same play (Lys. 277 278). Reisig’s conclusion that
the two cola just cited are Glyconics is invalidated (to say no more) by
the strictness of Glyconic form everywhere maintained by Aristophanes.
To avoid the correspondente Ξῦυ. in 7, Meineke proposed τὰς

, κύνας for γυναῖκας (MSS.).
On the form of the catalexis of the trimeter in 3 compare the tetra-
meter in Av. 1724 f.

Ecclesiazusae 968-971 = 972-97 5

Two choriambis tetrameters and an iambic dimeter and dochmius.
The dochmius is here admirably adapted to express the emotion of the
singer, and occurs in just this form, in connection with iambics, else·
where in Aristophanes in passages of intense feeling, in cornic imitation
