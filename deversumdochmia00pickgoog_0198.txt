‘Logaoedic' Matre in Greek Comedy 31

tion of the first syzygy oi Pherecrates 64, r. (See p. ²7·) Cola 4, 8,
13 are mixed choriambic dimeters. Colon 5 is logaoedic, and 6 a
Phalaecean, with the first syllable prefixed and trilled. The remaining
cola are Glyconics. ’

When these cola are tested by the standard of the comic poet’s own
practice, his rival's reckless aud shanreiul disregard of metrical form
becomes apparent. A sufficient number of these cola are deformations,
when judged by the severe and simple taste of Aristophanes, to damn
the lyric as a whole. He himself never forces a syllable to do double
duty, in order to secure a peculiar musical effect (6). He nowhere
employs a mixed choriambic dimeter ol the form υυυυυυ .υυ. (4,
13), nor polyschematist dimeters such as υυυυυυυυ (7) and ..υ
.υυ. (11, acephalous), nor Glyconics such as υυυυυυυυυ and υυ.υ
m. (14, 161). Itis the last two that Aeschylus, as the representative
of Aristophanes, especially reprobates. As he holds them up to ridicule,
with much humor he incidentally forces Dionysus to perpetrate a third
monstrosity (15) of which Euripides presumably was never guilty.

Those parts of Greek Comedy‚ except prosodiacs (p. 2), which
have been treated by eminent modern metricians as ‘logaoedic' bave
now been iully analyzed according to the doctrine ol Hephaestion.
The question naturally recurs with which this paper began. Do the
lyrics aud the stichic periods that have come under consideration
consist, as Heliodorus and Hephaestion believed, of choriambic, iambic,
antispastic, and polyschematist dimeters and trimeters, oi the value,
common to all, ol 12 or 18 times, or are they ‘logaoedics’ under the
modern definition of that term, and is the movement throughout ‘dac-
tylic'? Ι do not propose to discuss this question, but simply to adda
few words oi explanation and comment.

That the current definition of logaoedics does not rest on the authority
oi ancient metricians is generally conceded. Rossbach and Westphal
state this fact, apparently with no thought that any other view can be
entertained,² but Christ⁸ cites Diomedes and Bassus aud Goodell
