2 Jolm Wille‘ums Wlee'te

Modern writers on Greek mette, G. Hermann (sparingly), Btckh,
Rossbach and Westphal, and many others, have extended the applicass
tion of the term ‘logaoedic' to include cola that contain a single
‘dactyl’ (or single, but isolated, ‘dactyls’). This view oi logaoedic
mette, chiefly through the powerful exposition oi Rossbach and West-
phal, is now current. It has recently been strongly re·eniorced by
the acute reasoning of Goodell.l But it is not the view oi the Greek
metricians, wh0, while they are not always in accord in the application
oi their theory, agree that the cola which are now under considera-
tion are to be measured differently. According to Heliodorus and
Hephaestion, the unit of measurement is here a ‘ioot’ that in its
normal iorm contains iour syllables and six times (χρόνοι).

The current ‘logaoedic’ measurement oi the metres in question has
twice received fairly complete exposition in its application to Greek
comedy‚ in Rossbach and Westphal's Spece'elle Ger'eeleeselze Meleik² and
in J. H. H. Schmidt’s Antike Compest'tr'enslelere.⁸ But, so far as 1 am
aware, the lyrics and stichic periods oi comedy that have been classified
as⁴ ‘logaoedic' have never been iully presented in any modern treatise
in the forms demanded by ancient metrical theory. Ι purpose, there-
fore, in what follows to analyze them in accordance with the doctrine
oi Hephaestion, with such aid as may be got from the Heliodorean
metrical scholia on Aristophanes. F air opportunity will thus be afforded
for comparison.

I exclude from present consideration the lyrics in Aristophanes
written, in whole or in part, in the mette made famous by Telesilla.
There are six oi these lyrics‚ besides isolated occurrences oi the line, in
Aristophanes, and the form occurs also in Cratinus and Hermippus3
but the Telesilleum, according to Hephaestion,⁴ is a mixed Ionic colon,
and the discussion of it belongs elsewhere.
