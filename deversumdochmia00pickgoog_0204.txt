‘Logaoedic' Matre in Greek Comcdy 37

the entity oi the antispast aud choriamb as fundamental feet. Both
are in ξ time and are in ascending rhythm. The former is a foot that
usually occurs in combination with au iambic syzygy and is marked by
shift oi rhythmic stress always in the second halland sometimes also in
the first. The choriamb, which is rarely used ‘pure,’ is always marked
by shift of stress in the first hali, never in the second. Syucopation
in modern music, my colleague, Professor Spalding, informs me, always
gives an enlivening effect; whatever the sentiment may be that is
conveyed by the verses to which the music is set, and it may greatly
vary, inversion oi stress animates the melody. It is precisely the
device, therefore, that we should expect to find applied in ‘logaoedic’
verse, which, to characterize it briefly, is a vigorous metre of all work.
That the Heliodorean and Hephaestionic doctrine oi metres assumes
a ποὺς δωδεκάσημος or ὀκτωκαιδεκάσημος 'as the unit of measurement
in rhythms in g time is obvious. The dimeter, in particular, prevails
everywhere, not only in the metres considered in this paper, but also in
lyric iambic and trochaic metres and in the iambic and trochaic tetra·
meters oi recitative verse. Among these the mixed cola oi ‘logaoedic'
metre, it may be conceded, are complex. As M. Weil has remarked in
his luminous explanation of the Glyconic, Greek rhythmic was a highly
developed art. The embarrassment and difficulty, however, which we
