to show clearly what his sole purpose is in the prolonged argumentation
oi this chapter and oi most ot the third book. There is no hint here,
or elsewhere, that he is rhythmiziug. Whoever believes that heis must
accept the consequence, and be prepared to find dactylic rhyfflm not
only in antispastic and choriambic metre, hut also in both the Ionic
forms.1

Those who reject the doctrine ot Heliodorus and Hephaestion sorne-
times speak in a light-hearted and semi-contemptuous way oi the cola
and periods recorded in the Manual as “paper-schemes,” and assert
that Hephaestion's mode oi procedure, in determining the constitution
ot a metrical series, was to ‘chop off' syllables tour ata time, and, it at
the eud there was a remainder, to take refuge in brachycatalexis or
hypercatalexis. This, ot course, is pleasantry, as a glauce at the metrical
analyses oi the lyrics discussed in this paper will show. Hephaestion
was not ignorant oi the allowed substitutions ior normal forms in all
these dimeters and trimeters, nor oi the fact that, as the result oi lawiul
substitutions, ieet might contain five or even six syllables, and he had a·
singularly clear comprehension oi the forms oi catalexis. But this
pleasantry recoils upon its projector, for it seems to be true that the
lyrics of Aristophanes, at least, both here and elsewhere duly admit the
measurement prescribed by the “schemes '’ oi Hephaestion.

Finally objectionis taken to the great variety and apparent irregularity
ot form in these cola, and it is asserted with confidence that they are
not rhythmical.

The application oi the ‘logaoedic' theory obliterates in many oi these
cola, ior example in the choriambo-iambic and the antispastic‚ the metri-
cal identity ot iambic syzygies that are recognized as iambic by Helio·
dorus and Hephaestion. But these iambic syzygies may, ior the present,
be dismissed. A sufficient number ot unmixed iambic cola remain in
the lyrics that have come under consideration above to point an
important fact. These cola are free from admixtute with choriambs or
antispasts and are common ground both ior those who adopt and ior
those who reject the ‘logaoedic’ theory and must be dealt with by
both in the same manner3 whether Hermann’s ‘anacrusis’ is recognized
or not does not affect the rhythm ot iambic cola. Now it is precisely
these iambic cola which show the greatest variety, and tor that matter
