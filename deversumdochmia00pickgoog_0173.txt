Bentley and Porson, demanding exact choriambic correspondence in
choriambic cola (.υυ. with -υυ.), proposed many changes of text in
this lyriC, the former τονδὶ (533) for τόνδε R V, γένοιθ’ milvos γ’
ἐθέλων (536 f.) for γένοιτο νῦν οὗτος ἐθέλει R V, and the latter νῦν
δὴ (526) for νῦν δὲ RV, δεῖ τι λέγειν (527) for λέγειν τι δεῖ RV,
α’ ἐθέλει (537), ὥς δ’ ε’πὶ πάντ’ ἐλήλυθεν (636) for αῖς δὲ πάντ’ dart-
λήλυθεν R V. ln the last case Porson doubted the equivalence of
choriambic dimeter and Glyconic. I know no exact parallel to this in
comedy (Hermann proposed one in Thesm. 990 : 995 —see p. ao
below), but this correspondence is not so difficolt as thatin Eq. 3 3² =
406, where the parody fixes the form and forbids emendation. In 5 34
Bentley added νῦν, transferring it from 536. Porson corrected (542 f.)
δ’ ἂν ἒν ταῖσιν όδοῐσιν (ὁδοῖς R) ἁπάσαις . . . καλοίμεθ’ R V to the
reading given above. The last syzygy of colon 13 of the antode is
lacking in the Mss.

Besides the four cases of correspondence of choriambus with iambic
syzygy that are found in the lyric under consideration, the following
also occur in cola that have not been emended: -ῦυ. Lys. 324 = 338,
Ξῦυ. Lys. 326: 340, Δία. Ach. 1151 : 1163. Thus .ῦυ. occurs
four timeS, Ξῦυ. twice, and -υ”υυ. once.

I add, in order to afford means of comparison‚ the correspondentes
in lyric iambic syzygies, the text of which has not been emended, that
occur among the lyrics discussed in this paper: ῦ.υ. N ub. 9 51 = 1026,
