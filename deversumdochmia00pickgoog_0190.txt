tional variation of form. Hephaestion fully recognizes and adequately
descrstres this form of ὼε dimeter in his account of the polyschematist
Priapean (57, 14 ff.): τὸ Πριάπειον, οὗ μόνον ἰαμβική τῇ δευτέρᾳ
χρώμενον, ἀλλὰ καὶ χοριαμβικῇ· καὶ τὸν ἀντίσπαστον ἔσθ’ ὅτε, τὸν
πρῶτον τοῦ παντὸς μέτρου, εἰς σπονδεῖον περαιοῦσιν, ἐάν τε ἀπὸ ἰάμβου
ἄρχηται, ε’άν τε ἀπὸ τροχαίου, κατὰ τὸ δεδομένον, ἐάν τε ἀπὸ σπονδείοο.
Hephaestion here unequivocally designates the first syzygy as antispastic,
notwithstanding its additional variation of form. Itis, in truth, multi-
form. Τὴο opening movement may be not only υ. and ,υ and ..,
but also υυυ; ὼε following movement is .υ or Hephaestion
classifies these antispastic-choriambic dimeters, examples of which he

found in Corinna, as ‘polyschematist Glyconics’ (58, 3ff.). The ·

forms that particularly struck his attention were υυυ.υ .υυ. and ....
..... Both frequently occur in comedy, especially the latter.

This form of the δίμετρον μικτόν occurs in 1457-1461 = 1469-
1473 of the following lyric:

The -first seven cola are mixed choriambic (r, 3, 4, 6, 7) or iambic
dimeters (2, 5). The last five are ‘polyschematist’ dimeters. The
normal form of catalexis in the latter, the last member of the dimeter
being a choriamb, is seen in 12. Hephaestion is perfectly clear on this
point. In speaking of catalexis in choriambic metre he recognizes not
only an ῖαμβικὴ «arantes but also a choriambic3 the choriambic colon,
